        <p>My name is Vass Krisztian "Kristo" Patrick and I aspire to become a Web Developer, Game Programmer and Twitch Streamer</p>
        <p>Recently I started working on my web developing skills to find a job in this department.</p>
        <p>This is a small snippet about me</p>
    </div>

    <div class="twitch-career">
        <!--Insert image twitch icon-->
        <img src="images/bw-10-512.png" width="120" height="120">
        <p>I started streaming from a young age, about 13-14 years old when Halo 4 came out on the xbox 360</p>
        <!--Show image of Halo 4 or You streaming Halo 4-->
        <p>I stopped because of anxiety and highschool responsibilites but recently started streaming again and have almost 160 followers and 5 subscribers</p>
        <p>The plan is to keep doing it as a hobby until it can become a full time job. Until then I'm focusing on the IT part of my journey, more specifically Web Development</p>

        <p>Youtube is not a big part of my life when it comes to making videos.</p>
        <p>However, recently I made 4 videos about the <q>Hit Detection</q> in Halo 3 MCC.</p>
        <p>All videos blew me and made people talk about the issue even more. It even forced 343 Industries to <strong>FINALLY</strong> acknowledge the problem</p>
        <p>Now we are waiting for a fix which hopefully will give me the motivation to play and make more videos about Halo</p>

        <h1>Unity | RPG Maker | Game Developer</h1>
        <!--Show Unity Zombie Rush Image-->
        <p>Little over a year ago I started learning Unity and made a couple of games with the help of tutorials and documentation.</p>
        <!--Show "Black Curse Soul" Image-->
        <p>After that I started getting into Pixel Art and 8 bit games, which lead me to RPG Maker, a software design to create 8 bit games</p>
        <p>Sadly I had to put a hold to this part of my life and focus more on Web Development. MORE INFO ON THIS SOON!</p>

        <h1>The Developer of Webs</h1>
        <p>This is not my first blog, I created multiple small websites using <strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong></p>
        <p>This blog was made using only HTML & CSS to <q>test</q> myself in a way.</p>
        <p>All of my projects, no matter how big or small will go into my CV and onto my personal website (coming soon).</p>
